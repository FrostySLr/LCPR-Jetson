# License Plate Recognition System using Jetson Nano with Computer Vision and OCR
## Description
This project is a smart license plate detection and recognition system using Jetson Nano, Vehicle Loop Detector, and a USB Webcam. In this project, I use NoMachine to share the screen of the Jetson Nano on my laptop (which is what the USB Wi-Fi adapter is for)<br/>
However, it will also work if connected to a monitor or TV. I will be using Faster R-CNN for license plate detection and PaddleOCR for text extraction from the plate.
## Components
**MicroComputer**  
- NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4GB<br/>

**Microcontroller**
- Arduino UNO<br/>

**Sensors**

- Vehicle Loop Detector (/w atleast a 3 meter coil cable)

**Others**  

- USB Webcam (I use Logitech C922 for this project but it should work with most webcam)
- Wi-Fi USB
